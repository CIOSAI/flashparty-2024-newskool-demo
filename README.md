# Â¡Hola!

Esta es mi demo a la [Flashparty](https://flashparty.rebelion.digital/index.php/es/) 2024 de Argentina.

I've wanted to try out paper.js for a while, and I thought Flashparty is my chance to. Althought Argentina is very far away from where I live(Taiwan), it has a special draw to me being the only demoparty in Latino America. I want to make a demoparty in Taiwan, and seeing these extra-European parties thrive is really encouraging. Entonces, gracias Flashparty, para esta cosa especial, de hecho.
